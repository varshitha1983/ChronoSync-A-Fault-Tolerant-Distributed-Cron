# ChronoSync-A-Fault-Tolerant-Distributed-Cron
A fault-tolerant and highly available distributed task scheduler designed to manage and execute scheduled jobs reliably across multiple nodes. This project provides a robust alternative to traditional single-machine cron, ensuring that critical tasks are never missed, even in the event of system failures.
